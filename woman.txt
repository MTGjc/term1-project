Wait. Stop. 
One of you must die. 
Either you or my husband.
To be doubly disgraced, 
is more than I can bear.
I want... 
I will belong to whoever kills the other.
And then, after having taken advantage of me, 
he told me-oh, so proudly-
that he was the famous bandit Tajomaru. 

Even now I remember his eyes... 
What I saw in them was not sorrow, 
not even anger. It was...
a cold hatred of me.

Beat me, kill me if you must, 
but don’t look at me like that. 
Please 
don’t!

And then I fainted. 
When I opened my eyes and looked around,
I saw there, in my husband’s chest,
the dagger.
I didn’t know what to do. 
I ran through the forest-I must have, 
although I don’t remember. 

What could a poor helpless woman like me do?
