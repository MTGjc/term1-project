No, I’m telling the truth. 
I know you’re going to cut off my head 
sooner or later-
I’m not hiding anything. 
It was me, Tajomaru, 
who killed that man. Yes, I did it. 
all of a sudden there was this cool breeze. 
If it hadn’t been for that breeze,
maybe I wouldn’t have killed him.

First I saw her, 
then she was gone
I thought I had seen an angel. 
And right then I decided I would take her, 
that I’d have her even if I had to kill the man...
But if I could do it without killing him,
then that would be all the better. 
So I decided not to kill him 
but to somehow get the woman alone.
The road to Yamashina was hardly
the place to do it though.


She became very pale and stared at me as though her eyes were frozen. 
She looked like a child when it turns suddenly serious. 
The sight of her made me jealous of that man; 
She was fierce...
...determined.
She fought like a cat.
And so I had her-just as I’d planned
and without killing the husband. 
And that was how I did it. 
Besides, I hadn’t intended to kill 
him. But then...
he fought really well. 
We crossed swords over twenty-three times. 
Think of that! No one had ever 
crossed over twenty with me before. 
Then I killed him
The woman?
Oh, she wasn’t around anywhere. 
Probably got frightened and ran away. 
She must have been really upset. 
Anyway, when I came down the path 
again I found the horse grazing there. 
About that woman-
it was her temper that interested me, 
but she turned out to be just like any 
other woman. I didn’t even look for 
her.
the biggest mistake I ever made.
