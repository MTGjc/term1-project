I am in darkness now. 
I am suffering in the darkness.
Cursed be those who cast me into this hell 
of darkness.
The bandit, 
after attacking my wife
sat down beside her and tried to console her.
She sat there on the leaves, 
looking down, looking at nothing. 
The bandit was cunning.
He told her that after she had 
given herself, she would no longer 
be able to live with her husband
why didnâ€™t she go with him, 
the bandit, rather than remain behind 
to be unhappy with her husband? 
He said he had only attacked her 
because of his great love for her.
My wife looked at him, 
her face soft, her eyes veiled.
Never, in all of our life together, 
had I seen her more beautiful.
And what did my beautiful wife 
reply to the bandit in front of her 
helpless husband?
Take me. Take me away with you.
This is what she said.
But that is not all she did, or 
else I would not now be in darkness.
Kill him. As long as he is alive I 
cannot go with you.
"Kill him!"
I still hear those words.
